# CS4240-DL_Reproduce-_project_Fruit_Detection
In this github the code for the Reproduction project of the course CS4240 - Deep Learning of the TU Delft is shown which was implementd by Maxime Croft and Rosa Maessen.
The reproduction is done of the Paper Deep Fruit Detection in Orchards by Bargoti & Underwood.

The code is based on an existing code  https://github.com/pranayKD/faster_rcnn_colab_pytorch/blob/master/Faster_RCNN.ipynb . This code is a reproduction of the paper Faster r-cnn: Towards real-time object detection with region proposal networks by Ren et al. 

More information about the process of this reproduction is given on our blog: https://www.notion.so/Deep-Fruit-Detection-in-Orchards-0b6a154bdb074f278a03345cce4c8b05
